# **Hangman**

## **Planning Stage**
### Project Goals
My plan was to creare a user freindly game, that also has a range of easy words and harder less obviosy words to guess to give the player a challenge thats not impossible to play. The goal for this project was to create a claassic version of the game hangman, keeping in with the old school style of comppting in the earlier days by using ASCII art for the hangman disply.

### Game controls 
The game consits of a menu bar with 2 options to play or reset the game. Also entering the letter in which the player has guessed the secret word to be.
