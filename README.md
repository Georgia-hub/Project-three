# **Hangman**

## **Planning Stage**
### Project Goals
My plan was to creare a user freindly game, that also has a range of easy words and harder less obviosy words to guess to give the player a challenge thats not impossible to play. The goal for this project was to create a claassic version of the game hangman, keeping in with the old school style of comppting in the earlier days by using ASCII art for the hangman disply.

### Game controls 
The game controls consit of a menu bar with 2 options to begin and play or reset the game. Also entering any letter in which the player has guessed the secret word to be.

### Game rules
The player has to guess what the secret word is hidden by the underscores. The player will guess what letter they think may be in the word, if this is correct the letter will become visiable where this is placed in the word. If the player guesses all letters correctly then they have won game. If the player exceeds more than 6 wrong guesses then they will loose the game. The a

have 6 lives, if they guess right the player will win. If the player guesses 

### User Goals
The user goals for the game is for the player to guess all the letters corretly and reveal the hidden word to win the game.

### User Stories

### Design Goals
The design goal was to create a functional hangman game that has a range of easy and complex words to guess correctly or loose if not guessed correctly. When the player looses a life the stick man also looses a body part untill the man is hung and game is over.
* user friendly
* challeneg the user
* Hangman display of the stcik man loosing lives
* Customisation possiblities

### Design Choices
I decided to stay in line with traditail design for this game and created a stick man using ASCII art style.
* A classic version of the game
* A range easy and hard words
* Hangman visually loosing lives

#### Color Scheme
I wanted this game to be like hangman 101 so i decided to not do a color scheme and leave this in it's raw colors.

## **Features**
I created a menu for a feature at the begging of the game for the palyer to be able to commence playing the game or reset this again.
- Reveals letters as you've guessed correctly
- Random outcome choice for words picked
